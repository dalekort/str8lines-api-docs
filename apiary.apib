## Task [/proj]

A Task object has the following attributes:

+ uuid - the unique identifier of this object in the database (maps to uuid in db)
+ name - The name of the task
+ start_Date  - the start date of the task in the ISO 8601 format
+ end_date - the end date of the task in the ISO 8601 format
+ duration - the numeric part of the task duration (the number of units)

    + "ms" (milliseconds)
    + "s" (seconds)
    + "mi" (minutes)
    + "h" (hours)
    + "d" (days)
    + "w" (weeks)
    + "mo" (months)
    + "q" (quarters)
    + "y" (years)
+ effort - the numeric part of the task effort (the number of units). The effort of the "parent" tasks will be automatically set to the sum of efforts of their "child" tasks
+ effort_unit - the unit part of the task effort, defaults to "h" (hours). Valid values are:
    + "ms" (milliseconds)
    + "s" (seconds)
    + "mi" (minutes)
    + "h" (hours)
    + "d" (days)

+ baseline_end_date - the baseline end date of the task in the ISO 8601 format
+ baseline_pct_done - the baseline status of a task, expressed as the percentage completed (integer from 0 to 100)
+ calendar_id - the id of the calendar, assigned to task. Allows you to set the time when task can be performed. Should be only provided for specific tasks - all tasks by default are assigned to the project calen
+ scheduling_mode - the field, defining the scheduling mode for the task
+ manually_scheduled - When set to true, the StartDate of the task will not be changed by any of its incoming dependencies or constraints. Also, a manually scheduled parent task is not affected by its child tasks and behaves like any other normal task.
+ constraint_type - A string containing the alias for a constraint class (w/o the gntconstraint prefix). Valid values are:
    + "finishnoearlierthan"
    + "finishnolaterthan"
    + "mustfinishon"
